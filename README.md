# BearCoin
BearCoin is a simple cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin. 

Bearcoin currently includes modules for creating a ledger of transactions, checking for compliant nodes, 
and creating the beginnnings of a blockchain.

Named for both Brown University's mascot, and the fact that at this point in development you should be 
pretty bearish on it.
